Which version ?
---------------

The recommended version is 0.9.2

[squeryl\_2.8.0.Beta1-RC8-0.9.2.jar](http://github.com/max-l/Squeryl/downloads/squeryl_2.8.0.Beta1-RC8-0.9.2.jar)

Given that Squeryl is in itâ€™s infancy and that fixes are added
frequently,  
fixes can be found in the the *nightly* release.

The release process should become more formalized as Squeryl progresses
towards maturity.

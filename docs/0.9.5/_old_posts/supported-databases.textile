The databases currently supported are :

* Postgres

* Oracle

* MySQL

* H2

* DB2

* MSSQL (_note: query pagination is not yet supported_)   

* Derby

Supporting an additional database is pretty easy, have a
look at the existing adapters in the package : <notextile><a target = 'none' href='http://github.com/max-l/Squeryl/tree/master/src/main/scala/org/squeryl/adapters/'>org.squeryl.adapters</a></notextile>

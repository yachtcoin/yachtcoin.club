h2. Defining "Java friendly DAOs" in Scala  

A key goal in the design of Scala was interoperability with Java, and Martin Odersky succeeded amazingly well in this regard.  
 
Once a build is setup for compiling Java and Scala sources, the rest is very straight forward.

# Setup a build 

# Define the Schema classes in Scala, persistent classes should use @BeanInfo annotations, this will cause the compiler to generate Java style getters and setters for every property, the class will then look exactly like POJOs in the Java code.  

# Define DAOs (query wrappers) in Scala, with methods that take "Java friendly" types, which means any Scala types provided that they don't involve too many fancy closures !

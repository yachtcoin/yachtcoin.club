h3. 0.9.5

* Dynamic orderBy
* Fix error with enumerations within groupBy

h3. 0.9.5-RC2

* Cryptic error message upon field type deduction failure became more explicit.
* added transaction and inTransaction that takes a SessionFactory


h3. 0.9.5-RC1

* "List of closed tickets":http://www.assembla.com/spaces/squeryl/milestones/381461-0-9-5-rc1

h4. Additional changes : 

* migration to sbt 0.10.x
* Fix case statement with String (varchar) return type for Oracle
* SQLServer adapter quotes idendifiers
* SQL Server: Properly quote identifiers to allow using reserved words in field names
* added def transaction[A](s: Session)(a: =>A)
* Convert === None to SQL o is null
* fail safe close on the jdbc connection when it fails on commit or rollback
* Fixed an issue with retrieval of @ScalaSig data.
* Option type deduction was failing for POSOs with a lot of fields (~50).  This method relies more on scalap.  Also, added turned off SBTs default filtering of the scala-complier.  The compiler is a dependency of scalap and is necessary for the @ScalaSig retrieval and parsing.
* Changed ThreadLocal handing so that they get cleaned up after use. To be sure, all ThreadLocals are also initialized with null values.
* Support Enumerations in IN. Added also a test case of .? that does not compile
* adding update method to the ActiveRecord
* Postgres/DB2/Oracle now honor uninsertable field meta data flag
* Support unupdatable, uninsertable in schema DSL for columns
* Do not persist static fields of POSOs
* Add implicit so that nvl on a Timestamp followed by >= compiles.
* Previously, the compiler would report the following error:
* value >= is not a member of org.squeryl.dsl.NvlFunctionNonNumerical[Option[org.squeryl.PrimitiveTypeMode.TimestampType],org.squeryl.PrimitiveTypeMode.TimestampType]
* added implicit conv for Option[BinaryType]
* Fixed an issue where .leftOuter.inhibitWhen led to an inner join being performed by adding an inhibitWhen method on OuterJoinedQueryable.  This also means that inhibiting a leftOuter will now result in an Option[T] rather than an Option[Option[T]]
* Added implicts to handle lists of UUIDs
* Removal of deprecated  Boolean -> LogicalBoolean implicit conversion
* Fix of : having being inhibited when followed by compute


h3. 0.9.4 Final

h3. 0.9.4-RC2

*   Fix for issue 48 (Exception thrown in outer join with subquery member)

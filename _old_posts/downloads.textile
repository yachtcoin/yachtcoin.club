h2. Which version ?

The recommended version is 0.9.2

"squeryl_2.8.0.Beta1-RC8-0.9.2.jar":http://github.com/max-l/Squeryl/downloads/squeryl_2.8.0.Beta1-RC8-0.9.2.jar


Given that Squeryl is in it's infancy and that fixes are added frequently, 
fixes can be found in the the _nightly_ release.


The release process should become more formalized as Squeryl progresses towards maturity.

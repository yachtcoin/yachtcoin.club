h3. Q: Is Squeryl an ORM or a DSL ?

h3. A: It is both.

However it makes most sense to call it a DSL
that does 02R mapping. One could also say that it's an
ORM that has a DSL component, but I prefer the former definition
because the SQL like DSL aspect is where most of the value is
added : mapping tables to object is the easy part of the problem,
allowing application code to write as declaratively as SQL
while staying within the (intellectual) comfort of the Scala language 
is the most interesting part.
